# Claude Code 101 for Data Professionals

If you work with data — whether as a data engineer, analyst, or BI developer — you've probably heard about AI coding assistants. But most tutorials focus on web developers or general software engineering. What about us, the data folks?

This course will walk you through **Claude Code** — Anthropic's AI coding agent that runs right in your terminal. We'll start from the basics of how large language models work, go through installation and real-world examples, and finish with advanced topics like agent orchestration and extending Claude Code with external tools.
